          With a background in research science, I know what it takes to work
          diligently, collaborate meaningfully, and learn quickly in a highly
          technical environment. The collaborative nature of my career has made
          me a committed team member, and I have no doubt that my technical
          experience in web development paired with my career experience in
          management, dynamic problem-solving, and collaboration will make me an
          asset to any development team I join.
